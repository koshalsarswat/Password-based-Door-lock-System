# Password Door Lock System

Arduino-based secure door lock system with real-time password authentication, LCD feedback, and servo-controlled locking—fully simulated and tested in Tinkercad.

## Features
- 4x4 keypad for secure 4-digit password entry
- Displays status and prompts on 16x2 LCD
- Servo motor physically locks/unlocks door on correct password
- Alerts (optional: LED/buzzer) for wrong password
- Easily modifiable code and parameters
- Fully simulated in [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5yMFWl5JYLF-password-door-lock-system?sharecode=8HRC104RgoAsiyCs6Bs4R9eQdTi6l19vQ-O8_XGEnEo)

## Files
- `.ino` – Arduino code
- Image files – circuit simulation/screenshots

## Usage
- Open `.ino` file in Arduino IDE or Tinkercad Code editor
- Wire up the circuit as shown, or import in Tinkercad for simulation
- Default password is `1234` (changeable in code)
